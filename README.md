## Find Jobs 
This code is a web scraping program that fetches job listings from the TimesJobs website based on a search for "python" and filters out jobs that require certain unfamiliar skills. The program uses the BeautifulSoup library to extract information from the HTML of the job listings page, and saves relevant job information (company name, required skills, and link to more information) to a text file for each job listing. The program runs in an infinite loop and waits for 10 minutes between each run to avoid overwhelming the website with requests.
